# Home Credit Default Risk <br>

Predicting how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan <br>

Our aim is to find a tradeoff between biaseness and variance and find most optimal model that could predict defaulters.

# Notebooks

We have four main notebook

- Home-credit-default-risk-EDA.ipynb: This jupyter notebook is about pre-processing, visualization and feature engineering.

- Home-credit-default-Log_Regression.ipynb: Logistic Classification model has been applied as baseline model to check results.

- Credit-default-risk_Keras.ipynb: Applying neural network (using keras library) and make a comparison with baseline model(Logistic classifier).

- Home-credit-default-risk-ML.ipynb: Other models like Random Forest, Gradiant Boosting and Neural networks have been and best model has been selected out of them based on their evaluation matric.
